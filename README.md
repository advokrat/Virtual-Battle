# Virtual-Battle
This a game created by me which runs on interactive console. The game is based on C language.

Question.txt is the required question. It primarily contains the idea behind the game.
MainCode.c is the solution file for the Question.txt file.
MainCode.exe is the built file of the game. Download and Enjoy ;P

P.S. : By the time I realized what a CP question based on Game Theory is like, I had already made this game's basic framework. Also, it got pretty late to start from scratch. Therefore, I have attached this game herein. Please, do give it a look...
