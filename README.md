# Virtual-Battle
This a game created by me which runs on interactive console. The game is based on C language.

Question.txt is the required question. It primarily contains the idea behind the game.
MainCode.c is the solution file for the Question.txt file.
MainCode.exe is the built file of the game. Download and Enjoy ;P

P.S. : This game came into existence out of a confusion, but nevertheless, it was fun building it up...
